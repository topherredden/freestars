Do patrol orders filter on designs?
If you have a patrol fleet targeting armed ships, and the enemy sends an armed scout and an unarmed scout, which gets targeted.
Also, if there are two fleets that match, which does it pick?

How does Stars! calculates defense coverage for some one elses world?
A rough formula was posted on the NG or AH a while ago IIRC, we need to find and verify that, or figure it out ourselves
 - done, posted to AH
