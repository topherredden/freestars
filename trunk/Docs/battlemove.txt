Battle:

attractivness = BNR killed = #killed * BNR (defined in Rules) = max(dmg/dp,stack size)*BNR
(modified for weapons and defenses, 1 hit 1 kill not considered, but stack size is considered)

At start of round, find most attractive target (MAT)

Movement:
consider 9 options (8 surrounding and current position)
calc dmg done and dmg taken, in terms of BNR
Move to best square according to tactics, random if there are ties

If out of range of MAT, move closer, equal ranges, will go as above


I wasn't going to consider any future moves this turn, so each move is considered as if it's the last move for the turn. Which seems to match current battles
Also, I was going to count damage taken as if every ship will fire at the moving stack
"Disengaged if challenged" should flee if there is any enemy armed ships would be better


Need damage functions:

Stack A shoots at Stack B
Stack A shoots at anything in range
Stack A shoots for real at anything in range

ShootAt(Stack * shooter, Stack * target, bool ForReal);




[20:33] <OWK> Hmm. Might want to consider tactics.
[20:33] <OWK> Isn't one of the tactics that sort of needs fixed is "disengage if challenged"
[20:34] <OWK> If you're gonna get thwacked eventually if closing then that tactic should sorta convert into chicken
[20:34] <OWK> Or are we still concentrating on paralleling existing behavior? If so, then probably close towards MAT
[20:34] <LEit> A better option in that case is to set it to shoot unarmed only, and then flee
[20:36] <LEit> I'll fix a few things, like considering base range bonus for min damage
[20:37] <LEit> Hmm, I guess making "Disengaged if challenged" flee if there is any enemy armed ships would be better
[20:38] <OWK> Would seem to match closer what it is usually used for.  And that'd be a simple solution w/o it starting to do firepower/movement comparisons
[20:38] <LEit> What is known about attractivness? is it figured out or are there specific rules?
[20:39] <OWK> I think the formula is pretty solidly known.
[20:39] <LEit> Yeah, but that's for figuring which ship gets shot, not how it moves
[20:39] <OWK> It also appears to adjust on the fly taking damage and current shields into consideration
[20:40] <OWK> Ah. As in if you had equal target ships - does it move towards a damaged one rather than an undamaged one given a choice?
[20:40] <LEit> I was thinking that using the tactics for all 9 when any ship is in range of your weapons is probably best
[20:41] <LEit> No, as in you're in range of something, but not your MAT. Should you always move to the MAT or consider dealing with this enemy first?
[20:42] <OWK> I think it heads for the MAT.  Multiple cases of beamer groups going past each other and exchanging fire on the way to the missile ships/transports/bombers
[20:42] <OWK> hmm, probably headed for the chaff actually.  ;)
[20:44] <LEit> Hmm, so I should track range to MAT, damage done, and damage taken for all possible moves, and then pick the best that closes with the MAT if out of range
[20:46] <LEit> I wasn't going to consider any future moves this turn, so each move is considered as if it's the last move for the turn. Which seems to match current battles
[20:46] <LEit> Also, I was going to count damage taken as if every ship will fire at the moving stack
[20:47] <OWK> Any captain/unit commander would assume everyone is out to get him.  ;)
[20:48] <LEit> There is something that says if I'm going to die, inflict max damage possible
[20:48] <OWK> Well, that's an order option.
[20:49] <OWK> I guess a possible "future" option is some sort of "take them with me" thing
[20:49] <LEit> Actually that should work, just make sure I limit damage taken to total, and then damage taken will be the same everywhere, and the best ratio will be as close as possible
[20:59] <LEit> For the damaged/non-damaged issue, I'll calculate based on current values, so it'll go after damaged ones first
[21:01] <LEit> I'm not sure if it'll go after a stack of 2 or 1 first. Currently it goes after the bigger stack first
[21:09] <OWK> Going after damaged makes sense - - reduce enemy firepower ASAP
[21:10] <Orca> Going after the smaller stack makes more sense IMO
[21:10] <Orca> Replicating current behavior is what we're shooting for though...
[21:10] <Orca> Though there are times when you want to nail the bigger stack (say, if you can kill it quick)
[21:11] * GreyHawk sets mode: -bb *!*Cowmmando@*.mpoweredpc.net *!ircap@*.*
[21:11] <OWK> Hmm, tends to shoot the small stacks and obliterate them IIRC
[21:12] <Orca> I'll be back in a few hours, gotta go brave rush hour traffic to play taxi...
[22:43] <LEit> If it can't kill the smaller stack, it shoots at the bigger one. I'm not sure what happens if it can kill the stack
[22:52] <LEit> Battles are too complex and not well understood enough for me to try to get an exact copy, I'll just go for something similar
[14:37] <LEitW> Hmm, how should I determine the MAT for a ship with multiple weapon types (sappers and missiles for example)
[14:39] <LEitW> I suppose I'll just sum all weapons
[14:41] <Orca> Weapon damage?  Or taking into account range?
[14:49] <LEitW> For this, I'll consider range to be 0
