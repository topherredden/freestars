Issues with .hst:

* <Rules> section has been moved to the .xy
* Confirm numbering for new battleplans (hash?  Array?  What are we using here?)
* Include <Gift> flag under names for some ships/ship designs in .hst (added  as player 1 slot 1).
* Ship slots need built/in existance.  We have <Built>, added <Exist>
* Should we be recording instances where <Gift> is false?
* Should move password to where it's expected (back inside the race definition)
* Deleted extra <Energy> tech in Player 2's def.
* Inserted <Planet>Default</Planet> to default production queues.
* Wormhole entry/exit points are a bit weird.  Maybe just record a pair of locations, have the logic jump the fleet to the other location?  Right now we've got entry/exit points which doesn't make sense...
* Wormhole coordinates need to match <Location><XCoord/><YCoord/>, etc.
* <Wormholes> changed to <Wormhole>.
* Wormholes now have two <Endpoint>'s.
* MT destination and location corrected.
* Update FileVersion as appropriate.
* All instances of Colonists have been replaced by Population (update all other files!)

Issues with .hstnew:

* Minefields aren't recorded.
* CanLoadBy - should always be true for the race that owns it.
* Fleet Waypoints aren't recorded.
* Fleet 2 has an extra <Number> tag.
* <PacketDestination> isn't recorded.
* <Partial> in production queues isn't processed or recorded.
* Planet Tangent doesn't appear to be mining properly while Cosine is?
* Salvage doesn't decay (presumed to not be implemented at this time).
* MTs aren't recorded.
* Wormholes aren't recorded.

Issues with .x:

* Standardize PacketDestination/Speed.
* Standardize RouteDestination.
* Change FileVersion once this stuff is complete so Tom doesn't get annoyed at us.
* Make sure Research matches the .hst.
* Make sure Relations matches the .hst.
* Make sure Route matches the .hst.

Issues with .m:
* Need to define storage for Score.
* Need to update to match .hst.
